         <p>My dreams for the future are, work in IT, have a side business, and to make it big, like big house, luxury car and money to travel the world. My dream is to also change the world in some way or another, and to give to the unfortunate people around the world, like a philanthropist. Nobody like to see misery and I am no exception. I hate to see rich people with the money to end world hunger not doing anything to help, same with the government that allowed the people to live like that. My last dream is to not be forgotten like Napoleon and Albert Einstein, to have a grand legacy, and to be written in to history books, but I donâ€™t if that is realistic or not.</p>
